Temporal – Workflow Orchestration Framework

Temporal is a powerful open-source workflow orchestration engine that allows you to write reliable, fault-tolerant, and long-running applications using simple code. Instead of handling retries, state management, or failure recovery manually, Temporal takes care of it automatically — letting developers focus on business logic.

✨ Why Temporal?

Durable, stateful workflows

Automatic retries & error handling

Scalable distributed system

Code-based workflows (Java, TypeScript, Go, Python)

Guarantees workflow correctness even after crashes, restarts, or network failures
