# Daft

This branch contains a basic attempt at understanding **Daft**, a modern, distributed DataFrame library for Python.

The goal is to explore how Daft handles data processing, distributed computation, and interoperability with other frameworks such as PyArrow and Ray.  
It serves as a starting point to experiment with Daft’s core features like lazy execution, data partitioning, and optimization.

---
**Focus Areas**
- Setting up and running Daft locally  
- Exploring DataFrame creation and transformations  
- Comparing Daft’s performance and design with other data frameworks  

This branch is part of the larger repository exploring multiple frameworks for data processing and orchestration.
