# Pydantic Notes

This folder captures quick experiments showcasing classic Pydantic v1 usage.

- `pydantic.ipynb` – walk-through notebook that demos model validation, parsing, and error reporting.
- `type-hints.py` – Python script summarizing type hint patterns that pair well with Pydantic models.
- `__pycache__/` – ignored runtime bytecode; safe to delete if it appears.

Getting started:

1. Create a virtual environment in the repository root.
2. Install `pydantic` (v1) with `pip install pydantic`.
3. Open the notebook in your preferred editor (VS Code, Jupyter, or similar) and run the cells.
