# Pydantic AI Sandbox

Resources here explore the emerging `pydantic-ai` conversational agent toolkit.

- `pydantic-ai.ipynb` – notebook experimenting with the assistant API and response validation patterns.
- `sales_analysis_conversation.json` – captured conversation log for testing structured tool outputs.

Usage tips:

1. Activate the project virtual environment.
2. Install the preview package with `pip install pydantic-ai`.
3. Run the notebook to inspect how prompts, validators, and tool calls behave.
